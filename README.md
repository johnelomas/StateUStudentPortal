Student Portal for State U

Purpose of this project:

This project is a portfolio project to demonstrate my capabilities in creating and building a ASP.Net MVC web application with a SQL database.

I intend this project to be a reference point for my resume in the job search and interview process.

This project is to create a student portal for students at fictional State University. This portal allows students to edit certain personal data, review meal plan activitity, enroll in classes, review transcript among other possible activities.

My concentration will be on functionality rather than a "beautiful" front end.
